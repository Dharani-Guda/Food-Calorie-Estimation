**Food Calories Estimation**

We can observe that the majority of people in today's society worry about their daily calorie intake in order to lose or gain weight or to be healthy. To survive, the human body needs calories. Health problems can be caused by consuming too many or too few calories over time. By counting the calories in a food source, we may establish how much energy it contains.

The type of food and the volume of the food are required in order to calculate the calories and improve the accuracy of classifying the food from the top view of the image.

**Steps:**

1. Go to google colab file FoodClassification.ipynb
2. Mount it to your drive.
3. After running all the cells, download model_trained_11class.hdf5 and place it in this repository.
4. Run the app.py file.
5. You can see the website in your localhost as follows.
